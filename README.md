# Globe Trotters

The Globe Trotter app allows you to track every place you’ve visited with pins on a map and total up the number of states and the number of countries you’ve visited. This allows you to meet your travel goals and compete with your friends! You can also save notes at different locations to remember your favorite shops/restaurants or whatever memories you wish to note!
